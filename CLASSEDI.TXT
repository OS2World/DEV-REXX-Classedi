How to use it :

Classedi.exe is a PM program. For running it needs the VX-REXX runtime 
library vrobj.dll.

The application has a main window with scrolls bar and 6 buttons aside.
The window shows the name of all the classes of the system.

REFRESH
If something has chenged the number of classes in the system this button
will cause classedi to reread the entire list.

CREATE 
If you select one item in the window and the you press CREATE, the program
will create an instance of the choosen class.
i.e if you choose the calss folder then the program will create a folder...

De Register Class
As the name tells this button will cause the selected class to be erased
from the system. The DLL of the SOM will not be deleted and therefore will
remain in the OS2/dll directory.

Register Class
This is the most crytical function of the program and also the less usefull.
It allows you to install a new class by specifying the os2 dll directory,
the file-name of the dll (path +name) and the name of the class.
But since the name of the class is somewhere inside the DLL then you must
know it before using this program. However all the new som extensions are
provided with an installation procedure.

EXIT
Exit the program

WARRANTY

I release this program as freeware. I therefore don`t give any warranty
whatsoever about its reliability. The product is given as is without any 
form of support.

USE OF THE PROGRAM 

The program if badly used can cause seriously problems in your beloved OS/2.
So use it only if you know what you are doing. I coded it to provide a tool 
to remove the buggy som that sometime I find in internet. 
For instance if you have installed WPZip ( the SOM that enables you to list
the content of a zipfile ) and you find that your system is becoming crazy,
then normally you have to hope that who provided you with the SOM also gave
you a disinstallation program. If not then you could try to delete the DLL, 
and so going into a lot of trouble. Now if you use classedi, you can easily
delete the class from the system saving your poor OS/2.


LONG LIFE TO OS/2
DEATH TO MS programs

HOPE TO SEE A DAY WHEN THE NAME MS HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MAGAZINE FOREVER!
